# FOOD-RECIPE APP
The following project was created using ReactJS and Food Database API from Edamam. 

# Description
 - main page is surrounded with the search bar and a search button. When a user puts in the food name such as (chocolate, bread, pizza, etc.) the search goes through the database of foods and recipes to find the appropriate letters used in the search. Finally, displays the food name, picture, amount of calories which is in the food and the url link for following recipe for deeper instructions.
